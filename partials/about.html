<p>Inspect anything brought into the house go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway yet touch water with paw then recoil in horror yet cat slap dog in face. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box why must they do that, under the bed, or chase imaginary bugs, so step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle yet kitty kitty stare at ceiling light. </p>
